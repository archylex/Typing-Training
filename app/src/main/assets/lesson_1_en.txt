While many associate Seattle with coffee, rain or seafood, many Seattleites see the relationship between the city and cycling to be stronger. With the start of summer behind us and a refreshing shift in typical summer weather patterns, the increase of cyclists on the road is evident. As more hit the road either for leisure, work or competitive purposes, itâ€™s important to practice safe cycling methods to prevent injury. The common injuries associated with cycling are usually due to overuse and improper bike fit. Common injuries can include knee pain, hand pain and numbness, neck or back strain and foot numbness or tingling. If pain starts to occur in one of these areas, resting, icing the area and checking the bike fit would be a good start. However, if the condition persists, consult your physician.
